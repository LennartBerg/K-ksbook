        These can include IP addresses, contact requests, meta and communication data, contract data, contact details,

        by a professional provider (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). If the appropriate consent has been requested, the
        processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar
        as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user's end device (e.g., device
        fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
    <p>Our host(s) will only process your data to the extent necessary to fulfill their service obligations and to
        follow our instructions regarding this data.</p>
    <p>We use the following host(s):</p>

    <h4>Processing Contract</h4>
    <p>We have entered into a contract for order processing (OPC) to use the service mentioned above. This is a contract
        required by data protection law, which ensures that it processes the personal data of our website visitors only
        according to our instructions and in compliance with the GDPR.</p>
    <h2>3. General Notes and Mandatory Information</h2>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal
        data confidentially and according to the legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>If you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be
        personally identified. This privacy policy explains which data we collect and what we use it for. It also
        explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have
        security gaps. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3>Note to the Responsible Party</h3>
    <p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p>Sample Company<br/>
        Sample Way 10<br/>
        90210 Sample City</p>
    <p>Phone: +49 (0) 123 44 55 66<br/>
        Email: info@samplecompany.com</p>
    <p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and
        means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
    <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
    <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will
        remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
        deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally
        permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the
        latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
    <h3>General Notes on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
    <p>If you have given your consent to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR if special categories of personal data are processed according to Art.
        9 para. 1 GDPR. In the event of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data
        processing is also based on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to
        the access of information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is also based on
        § 25 para. 1 TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the fulfillment of a
        contract or for the performance of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1
        lit. b GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if this is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation on the basis
        of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR. Data processing may also take place on the basis of our legitimate interest
        according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The respective legal basis on which processing is based in individual
        cases is informed in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>As part of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes also requires the
        transmission of personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if
        this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obliged to do so (e.g., transfer of data
        to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR in passing it on,
        or if another legal basis allows the data transfer. When using contract processors, we only pass on personal
        data of our customers based on a valid contract on order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract
        on joint processing is concluded.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent you have
        already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains
        unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE
        PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN
        THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN
        DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS,
        OR IF THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21
        ABS. 1 GDPR).</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY
        TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO
        PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL
        SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 ABS. 2 GDPR).</p>
    <h3>Complaint Right with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, those affected have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
        authority, especially in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the
        alleged violation. The right to complain is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract
        automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require
        the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent that is
        technically feasible.</p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about
        your stored personal data, their origin and recipient, and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a
        right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of
        personal data, you can contact us at any time.</p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any
        time for this purpose. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For
            the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
            data.
        </li>
        <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is carried out unlawfully, you can request the restriction of
            data processing instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them to exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you
            have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
        </li>
        <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR, it must be weighed up between your
            interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be
        processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or to protect the
        rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a
        Member State.</p>
    <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
    <p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as orders or inquiries, which you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted
        connection by the fact that the browser's address line changes from "https://" to "https://" and by the lock
        icon in your browser line.</p>
    <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h3>Objection to Promotional Emails</h3>
    <p>The use of contact data published within the scope of the imprint obligation for sending unsolicited advertising
        and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
        legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
    <h3>Server Log Files</h3>
    <p>The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server log files, which your
        browser automatically transmits to us. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Browser type and browser version</li>
        <li>Operating system used</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>Hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>Time of the server request</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A merger of this data with other data sources is not performed.</p>
    <p>The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate
        interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website – for this, the server log
        files must be recorded.</p>
    <h3>Inquiry by Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>
    <p>If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
        request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this
        data without your consent.</p>
    <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment
        of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
        processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us (Art. 6
        para. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can
        be revoked at any time.</p>
    <p>The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
        consent to the storage or the purpose for data storage lapses (e.g., after completed processing of your
        concern). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
    <h3>Comment Function on this Website</h3>
    <p>For the comment function on this page, in addition to your comment, information about the time the comment was
        created, your email address and, if you are not posting anonymously, the user name you have chosen will be
        stored.</p>
    <h4>Storage Duration of the Comments</h4>
    <p>The comments and the associated data are stored and remain on the website until the commented content has been
        completely deleted or the comments need to be removed for legal reasons (e.g., offensive comments).</p>
    <h4>Legal Basis</h4>
    <p>The storage of the comments is based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke a given consent
        at any time. For this, an informal notification via email to us is sufficient. The legality of the already
        completed data processing operations remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h2>5. Newsletter</h2>
    <h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
    <p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we need an email address from you, as well as
        information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to
        receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or is collected only on a voluntary basis. We use this
        data exclusively for sending the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.</p>
    <p>The processing of the data entered into the newsletter subscription form is based solely on your consent (Art. 6
        para. 1 lit. a GDPR). You can revoke the consent you have given for the storage of the data, the email address,
        and their use for sending the newsletter at any time, such as through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.
        The legality of the already completed data processing operations remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <p>The data deposited with us for the purpose of obtaining the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe
        from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter.
        Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.</p>
    <p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your e-mail address may be stored in a blacklist, if
        this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is only used for this purpose and not
        merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements
        when sending newsletters (legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is
        indefinite. <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests override our legitimate interest.</strong>
